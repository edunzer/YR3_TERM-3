#THEME READING 1,2,3

__Question:__ *How do these articles benefit the reader?*
  `Now despite the 3 articles having different topics and ideas I found that all had a rather similar message. That is in order to complete your understanding of events, choices, or others you have to spend time reflecting on what actually happened. As stated by Danial Kahneman the most “critical part of the story is how it ends” and if you don’t reflect on past events you will always view them through there endings. By increasing your analysis and thought of past events you can better understand them and help your future opinions on things that happen. After listening to Sheena Lyengar’s TED talk it really made me think about people and how small differences in their environments could easily change the way they make life choices. This in itself was very eye opening, but also caused me to create a new category in my mind of analyzing people. That is when I notice someone’s behavior should I consider that there up brings as a possible reason? This constant analysis may seem exhausting to some but personally I think we really have gotten lazy in our nature. As pointed out in the article The awe of being alive it seems like people are taking more shortcuts then before because there is so much more exposure to the issues. When trying to solve a huge problem in your life it is easier to try what you seen others do instead of reaching a solution on your own.`

__Question:__ *Why does the American education system continue to uphold its outdated and lackluster system despite the huge amound of information that points to other methods?*
  `Well isn this a great question that all of us have probably thought about. Of course, I could give the simple answer that most people are lazy and don’t want to change but what fun would that be. In reality I think the main variable that halts education change is the fact there are so many difference in students and people. As we have seen in more recent data there is no one way to teach everyone. People are raised differently and because of that they learn differently. So, when it comes down to it if we were to change what would it even be? Should there be tests and data that would categories people or would that cause even more problems. Should there be the same school system until high school and then everything changes? This is the problem that we are facing. Despite the data that shows American students learn and do better without structure what would happen to the students that need structure? As an explain online classes and schooling has been an amazing change for me personally as it affords me flexibility for those days that I’m not wanting to do marketing assignments but writing sounds great. But for someone else that needs a teacher in class with them to push them to do work it would be impossible for them to complete assignments then it wouldn’t work at all. And if this is true in a college environment then image younger students trying to complete work on there own time. So where would the line of independent learning be drawn, and the structural learning take over?`

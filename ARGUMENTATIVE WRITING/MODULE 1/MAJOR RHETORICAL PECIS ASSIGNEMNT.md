      `The Riddle of Experience vs. Memory by Daniel Kahneman`
        https://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_kahneman_the_riddle_of_experience_vs_memory/transcript?language=en

      __Sentence one (what)__
        *(author) in the (editorial), (title), (claims) that (explanation)*
          `Daniel Kahneman, a psychologist known for his work on judgement and decision making, talks about his paper 'The riddle of experience vs. memory' in a 2010 TED conference where he claims the mind irrationally takes in what has actually happened and therefore changes our decisions. `

          `Kahneman suggests in his talk that the mind often takes experiences into distorted memories that often focus on pain, or the notable end of an experience and therefore forgets everything else about the experience.

          `Kahneman talks much like a professor with structured examples and little to no adlibbing, this requires a more attentive mind to pay attention and follow the many subtle points that are given.`

    *Notes*
      `Participants of the study did better in life when in a supportive constructive relationship. And even though this is said it is not supported by the common young person. Younger generations tended to prefer acheivemnt and money over relationships. Issues with someones life were increased when there was problem in Happiness within relationships. The oppoiste was true for people that had good relationships, they were numbed to hard life events.`

  __Reading Theme 5 (DAN GILBERT)__
    *Rhetorical statement*
        `Dan Gilbert on the TED stage talks about his paper 'The surprising science of happiness', which claims that our brains change the amount of real happiness that we can acheive. Gilbert supports his claims by showing the many aspects of our newly developed pre frontal cortex, and studies that have to do with choice and loss. The purpose of the talk is to show our brain has a huge amount of power over our thougts, and our lack of knowledge over what is truely happening greatly effects our appearent feelings toward outcomes. Gilbert talks in a very informal but strustured matter which premotes laughter at funny anicdotes but also gives solid information to think about.`

    *Notes*
      `two different kinds of happiness, natural and sinthetic. you tend to think things you have gotten are better then they are. and the things that you didnt get are worse then you thouht before. This is a method of the brain protecting your happiness levels by increasing the happiness you get from things that are more avaible to you.`

  __Reading Theme 6 (CATHERINE WILSON)__
    *Rhetorical statement*
        `Catherine Wilson writes 'How to be an epicurean' in the Aeon, which states that peoples increased exposure to quick ways to happiness has halted there ability to understand there own needs and wants. Wilson supports her claims by showing the main disperaties in others philisophical thoughts, and how the situation of the time had a large hold over what happiness was seen as. The purpose of the article is to point out that there is no right answer to this impossible question but rather solutions that provide many differnet paths and outcomes to fit the current situation. Wilson offers a story book like delivery that draws in the reader like they are being told a tale about what it is to be happy.`

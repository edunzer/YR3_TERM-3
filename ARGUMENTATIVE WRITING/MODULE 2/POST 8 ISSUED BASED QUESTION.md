## POST 8 FORMULATING USSUE BASED QUESTION

  __INSTRUCTIONS:__

    *First, review Chapter 5 in our course textbook, From Inquiry to Academic Writing--especially the "Steps to Identifying Issues" on page 122, "A Practice Sequence: Identifying Issues" on page 125-126, and "Steps to Formulating an Issue-Based Question" on page 130.*
      `Then, create a post in which you practice the five-step process given under "A Practice Sequence: Formulating an Issue-Based Question" on page 130-131.`
      `For each step of the process given, you should explore the topic of Happiness (our course topic) in some way, and write 1-2 sentences for each step.`

    *IMPORTANT NOTE: You need to explore the topic of Happiness in some way that is literally answered by/spoken about in our course themed readings. Your synthesis question should not extrapolate from those readings or apply those readings to an outside issue, as your synthesis will be a review of the existing research on the topic, not an argument using those sources as evidence. So, you can't use a synthesis question like "How is happiness affected by social media," because none of the theme authors address this specific question. Save specific applications of the research for your final essay.*

    *Finally, close your post by putting your question in context with at least one of our themed readings. That is, write 1-2 sentences in which you explore either a.) how one of our themed reading authors might answer your question themselves vs. how you might answer; b.) how one of our themed reading authors "set the stage" for/inspired your question; c.) how one of our themed reading authors gives an example or illustrates what you mean when you ask your question; or d.) how you otherwise make a connection between your thinking and what you've read on the topic thus far this term.*
      `For ease of feedback and organization, number each of your steps in your post (1-6, with the first five being the textbook steps and the last being the step of putting your question in context with one of the themed readings).`

  __ASSIGNMENT:__ *"Why focus on happiness when goals are more influential."*

    *Step 1:* Examine your topic from different perspectives.
      `Do the lack of choices in others’ lives make them focus on happiness instead of achieving goals to better their lives?`

    *Step 2:* Explore the source of your interest in this topic and what you want to learn.
      `I have always been interested in why people tend to relate their lives to other people apparent happiness instead of fulfilling their own lives. `

    *Step 3:* Determined what is open to dispute.
      `What is "influential" in some people’s lives. Could there lives revolve entirely around happiness and that’s why it is constantly thought of?`

    *Step 4:* Use your question to focus your inquiry.
      `The fact that people’s lives could revolve around happiness and nothing else could be why they never see goals and meaning as a better alternative.`

    *Step 5:* Reflect on what readers may know about the issue, why they may be interested, and what you would like to teach them.
      `I am interested in why people focus on happiness rather than goals because I want people to less focused on the apparent happiness of others. Instead focusing on achieving ones goals and applying meaning to your life can create much needed structure in our culture.`

    *Step 6:*
      `Emily Esfahani Smith, the author of 'The Power of Meaning' talked about how there is more to life than being happy, and that the pursuit of happiness almost always ends in the opposite. She suggested that happiness is the unachievable fantasy that we often aim for, when in reality it is better to focus on the meaning of your life. These points made by Smith made me think that people focus only on happiness because they do not know any other way. The possibility that they have never been exposed to applying meaning to their lives or achieving goals could be causing this focus on unachievable happiness.`

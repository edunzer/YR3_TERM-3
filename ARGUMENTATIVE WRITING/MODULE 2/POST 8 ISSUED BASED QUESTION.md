## POST 8 FORMULATING USSUE BASED QUESTION

  __INSTRUCTIONS:__

    *First, review Chapter 5 in our course textbook, From Inquiry to Academic Writing--especially the "Steps to Identifying Issues" on page 122, "A Practice Sequence: Identifying Issues" on page 125-126, and "Steps to Formulating an Issue-Based Question" on page 130.*
      `Then, create a post in which you practice the five-step process given under "A Practice Sequence: Formulating an Issue-Based Question" on page 130-131.`
      `For each step of the process given, you should explore the topic of Happiness (our course topic) in some way, and write 1-2 sentences for each step.`

    *IMPORTANT NOTE: You need to explore the topic of Happiness in some way that is literally answered by/spoken about in our course themed readings. Your synthesis question should not extrapolate from those readings or apply those readings to an outside issue, as your synthesis will be a review of the existing research on the topic, not an argument using those sources as evidence. So, you can't use a synthesis question like "How is happiness affected by social media," because none of the theme authors address this specific question. Save specific applications of the research for your final essay.*

    *Finally, close your post by putting your question in context with at least one of our themed readings. That is, write 1-2 sentences in which you explore either a.) how one of our themed reading authors might answer your question themselves vs. how you might answer; b.) how one of our themed reading authors "set the stage" for/inspired your question; c.) how one of our themed reading authors gives an example or illustrates what you mean when you ask your question; or d.) how you otherwise make a connection between your thinking and what you've read on the topic thus far this term.*
      `For ease of feedback and organization, number each of your steps in your post (1-6, with the first five being the textbook steps and the last being the step of putting your question in context with one of the themed readings).`

    *Introduction*
      `"Why focus on happiness when goals are more influential." After reading through the 9 articles that we have had so far, I think the most important take away is that happiness is not something you aim for in life. Instead you have to go through life with goals and needs set so that you can progress through your ups and downs of happiness. Then when looking back on your life so far you will not just see those times that you have been sad or unhappy but instead you will see everything that has been accomplished. This idea is brought up in both Emily Esfahani Smith's TED talk 'The Power of Meaning' and in Avram Alperts article 'The Good-Enough Life'. Both these authors state that happiness has been molded into this this false idea of something that can be seen of achieved, when instead happiness is a secondary characteristic of meaningfulness of one’s life. This topic is also brought up in Robert Waldinger's TED talk 'What makes a good life' were a 75-year study showed that personal relationships were a large factor in the achievement in happiness or rather meaningfulness.`

    *Body*
      `Avram Alpert, a writer for The New York Times, discusses how the desire to be great can be an obstacle to your potential in his article 'The Good-Enough Life' published on February 20th, 2019. Alpert suggests in his article that a pre-defined life is one that will always be filled with disappointment, instead of defining it you should evolve with life to decide that is "great" and what is just okay. He supports his claims by reviewing several points of view from great thinkers where often the result of greatness is the failure to achieve it and instead forgetting about pre-determined ideas of accomplishment is the best way to live a "good enough life". Alpert proposes this idea in order to separate people from thinking that certain ideas are great and that greatness in a whole is so fluid that you cannot aim for it in life achievement. Alpter writes in a formal manner that uses multiple examples and literary passages in order to prove the different points that are being made.`

      `Robert Waldinger on the TED stage talks about his paper 'What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness', which claims that personal relationships inprove life. Waldinger supports his claims by comparing the many different men in a 75 year study which recorded the ins and outs of there lives from 15years old to the present. The purpose of the talk is to show the lasting effects that personal relationships have on the human life. Waldinger enables a funny and easy going atmosphere in his talk to enable an easy to listen to speach while still conveying the importance of the study.`

      `Emily Esfahani Smith, the author of 'The Power of Meaning' talked about how there is more to life than being happy, and that the pursuit of happiness almost always ends in the opposite. She suggested that happiness is the unachievable fantasy that we often aim for, when in reality it is better to focus on the meaning of your life. These points made by Smith made me think that people focus only on happiness because they do not know any other way. The possibility that they have never been exposed to applying meaning to their lives or achieving goals could be causing this focus on unachievable happiness.`

      `“Affect Balance as Mediating Variable Between Effective Psychological Functioning and Satisfaction with Life.” Journal of Happiness Studies, vol. 12, no. 3, 2010, pp. 373–384., doi:10.1007/s10902-010-9199-5. The article gives sound evidence about 'well-being' and what causes that well-being. There is Psychological background about well-being along with a study that included over 100 participants. The author Pilar Sanjuan is a research professor that focuses on emotion regulation.`

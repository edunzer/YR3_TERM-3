## POST 10 ANGLES OF VISION, SYNTHESIS, and "CAMPS" OF THOUGHT

  __DESCRIPTION:__
    *As I'm sure you're becoming increasingly aware, a Synthesis of Arguments presents an exploration of different "angles of vision" on--different ways of looking at--some core question by grouping different perspectives in "camps" of thought (for example, camps made up of authors that share the same angle of vision with each other).*

    *In the editorial cartoon below, you can see several different types of people (corporate executive, mall shopper, social activist, etc.) all stating what they "see" when they look at an icon (a sewing machine) representing a sweat shop. You can look at this cartoon as an example of a synthesis, with the different people representing "camps" or "teams" of shared answers on the synthesis question "What do you see when you think of a sweatshop?"*

    *This is what a synthesis does: It collects different individuals' points of view on an issue or question. If the cartoon above were expanded into a Synthesis of Arguments essay, each of the camps above would be discussed together, with a group of articles on the view of sweat shops as they affect the lives of union/U.S. workers, a group of articles on the view of consumer attitudes about sweatshops, a group of articles on the affect of sweatshop work on the workers/countries, etc.*

    *If you asked the question, "What is happiness?" of our course authors, for example, you could likely find several writers you could group together who might argue it only exists in the mind (like a state of mind or being; a philosophy), several who might argue it exists in reality (the result of specific practices), and several who might argue it doesn't exist at all. You will find you can imagine different camps of response to other questions--"What should workplaces do to increase happiness for their workers?"; "What is the best way to cultivate personal happiness?"; etc.--though some answers may require intelligent extrapolation and others may be directly addressed by a given author.*

    *In your last two post activities, you pursued an issue-based question to potentially use as the focusing question of your upcoming Synthesis of Arguments essay and researched an angle on the course theme that interests you. In this post, I'm asking you to explore how different stakeholders or concerned parties might see/approach/answer your question.*

  __INSTRUCTIONS:__
    *Draw a Cartoon for Your Synthesis Question. It doesn't need to be fancy--you can use stick figures or emojis if you like. Just write your question in the center of a square and then, around your question, draw 3-4 circles that you label with the names of "teams" of answers you see in our themed course readings. Inside those circles, draw labeled representations/faces of, or write the names of, at least 2-3 of our course authors who would join each team. Note: You can have an author that "plays" for more than one team, but you must have more than one player per team. You can also mimic the cartoon above.*

    *You can (and should, if applicable!) use the question/team and the outside research you came up with in earlier activity posts. :-)*

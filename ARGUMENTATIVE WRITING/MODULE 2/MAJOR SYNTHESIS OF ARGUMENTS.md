## MAJOR SYNTHESIS OR ARGUMENTS

  __INSTRUCTIONS:__

    *Purpose*
      `Identify an issue raised in multiple argumentative texts and formulate a synthesis question around that issue.`
      `Identify patterns in how different authors approach a question through their arguments.`
      `Analyze different approaches to an issue for an underlying source of disagreement.`
      `Establish the conversation for the argument you’ll make in the Researched Argument.`

    *Task*
      `Correct understanding and explanation of source texts’ main argument(s) and where texts agree/disagree with each other on your synthesis question.`
      `IMPORTANT: You are *not* arguing your response to your synthesis question and supporting it with source authors; rather, you are collecting groups of source authors and explaining how they illustrate different approaches/answers to your synthesis question.`
      `Clearly identified “argument camps” featuring more than one author per camp. Discussion of main arguments made by authors (rather than just comparing individual statements authors make), with sufficient details to explain fully.`
      `Explicit acknowledgment of any meaningful differences between authors within the same approach.`
      `Explicit acknowledgement of any meaningful differences between approaches.`
      `Explicit discussion of how each approach links to the thesis.`

    *Introduction*
      `Introductory context to the theme of the course texts you’ll be synthesizing and their names, including a preview of the authors you’ll be discussing.`
      `Synthesis question around which to analyze course texts for patterns (broad enough to apply to multiple texts but specific enough to address a particular issue).`
      `Preview of the 2-3 major approaches to your synthesis question and their basic arguments.`
      `Thesis (brief, analytic) explaining the underlying disagreement you’ve identified between the approaches.`

    *Body*
      `Topic sentences that explain the argument of a single approach (i.e. one approach to answering your synthesis question) in order to focus the paragraph.`
      `Paragraphs which focus on a single approach using more than one source each to fully illustrate each approach. (Note: You may use more than one paragraph to discuss a single approach, but not more than one approach should be discussed in a paragraph.)`
      `Evidence for each approach in the form of appropriately integrated and documented examples from course authors (“quote sandwich”), including a gist of individual arguments as they pertain to the identified issue/synthesis question.`
      `Transition words and other connecting language to make logical relationships between ideas and “conversations” between sources explicit.`

    *Conclusion*
      `Restatement/revisiting of synthesis question and approaches/ argument camps identified.`
      `Recap of main points/highlights from body paragraphs.`
      `Emphasis of significance of essay’s main findings (relevance/ implications).`

## MAJOR SYNTHESIS OF ARGUMENTS

  __INSTRUCTIONS:__

    *Purpose*
      `Identify an issue raised in multiple argumentative texts and formulate a synthesis question around that issue.`
      `Identify patterns in how different authors approach a question through their arguments.`
      `Analyze different approaches to an issue for an underlying source of disagreement.`
      `Establish the conversation for the argument you’ll make in the Researched Argument.`

    *Task*
      `Correct understanding and explanation of source texts’ main argument(s) and where texts agree/disagree with each other on your synthesis question.`
      `IMPORTANT: You are *not* arguing your response to your synthesis question and supporting it with source authors; rather, you are collecting groups of source authors and explaining how they illustrate different approaches/answers to your synthesis question.`
      `Clearly identified “argument camps” featuring more than one author per camp. Discussion of main arguments made by authors (rather than just comparing individual statements authors make), with sufficient details to explain fully.`
      `Explicit acknowledgment of any meaningful differences between authors within the same approach.`
      `Explicit acknowledgement of any meaningful differences between approaches.`
      `Explicit discussion of how each approach links to the thesis.`

    *Introduction*
      `Introductory context to the theme of the course texts you’ll be synthesizing and their names, including a preview of the authors you’ll be discussing.`
      `Synthesis question around which to analyze course texts for patterns (broad enough to apply to multiple texts but specific enough to address a particular issue).`
      `Preview of the 2-3 major approaches to your synthesis question and their basic arguments.`
      `Thesis (brief, analytic) explaining the underlying disagreement you’ve identified between the approaches.`

    *Body*
      `Topic sentences that explain the argument of a single approach (i.e. one approach to answering your synthesis question) in order to focus the paragraph.`
      `Paragraphs which focus on a single approach using more than one source each to fully illustrate each approach. (Note: You may use more than one paragraph to discuss a single approach, but not more than one approach should be discussed in a paragraph.)`
      `Evidence for each approach in the form of appropriately integrated and documented examples from course authors (“quote sandwich”), including a gist of individual arguments as they pertain to the identified issue/synthesis question.`
      `Transition words and other connecting language to make logical relationships between ideas and “conversations” between sources explicit.`

    *Conclusion*
      `Restatement/revisiting of synthesis question and approaches/ argument camps identified.`
      `Recap of main points/highlights from body paragraphs.`
      `Emphasis of significance of essay’s main findings (relevance/ implications).`

  __ASSIGNMENT:__

  `Happiness is seen as the goal for most people and has been the center of attention for most behavior psychologists for some time now. In the 1990's the positive psychology movement came about and caused a large amount of psychology research to focus on human happiness. So why haven’t we found out what makes us happy? Well the answer is simple and is given in many of those research studies. Happiness is not something that we need to focus on. As a whole our life consists of tons of ups and downs of happiness so focusing on it all the time can often have the reverse effect that you want. Instead you have to set goals and needs so that you can progress through your ups and downs of happiness. Then when looking back on your life to this point you will not just see those times that you have been sad or unhappy but instead you will see everything that has been accomplished. This idea is brought up in both Emily Esfahani Smith's TED talk 'The Power of Meaning' and in Avram Alperts article 'The Good-Enough Life'. Both these authors state that happiness has been molded into this false idea of something that can be seen or achieved, when instead happiness is a secondary characteristic of meaningfulness of one’s life. This topic is also brought up in Robert Waldinger's TED talk 'What makes a good life' were a 75-year study showed that personal relationships were a large factor in the achievement in happiness or rather meaningfulness. All these authors demonstrate that happiness in one’s life is always changing and if focused on will be impossible to reach. Instead creating goals, personal relationships, and applying meaning to your life can change the way you think about living.`

  `Robert Waldinger, a Harvard medical school professor, claims that personal relationships improve life in his paper 'What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness'. Waldinger supports his claims by comparing the many different men in a 75-year study which recorded the ins and outs of their lives from 15years old to the present. The purpose of the paper is to show the lasting effects that personal relationships have on the human life, and what signified happiness to a person. After explaining the study and how data was collected Waldinger goes through the many pieces of evidence that comes to the conclusion that "the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships, with family, with friends, with community."( Waldinger, 2015) This final point that is given is the most important part of the talk but only after you think about it. You see this paper outlines something is very important to remember; happiness in the studies definition was determined by the participants. There was a scale of 1 to 10 and the participants filled in their answer. They were never given a definition of what happiness was or how they should feel. But something we do know is that their lives were happier yes but as a whole they seemed to hold more meaningfulness through relationships.`

  `So, what is meaningfulness to someone? Well Emily Esfahani Smith's TED talk 'The Power of Meaning' gives a great outline. Stating that there is more to life than being happy, and that the pursuit of happiness almost always ends in the opposite. She suggests in her talk that happiness is the unachievable fantasy that we often aim for, when in reality it is better to focus on the meaning of your life. In her talk she gives an example of her father who instead of focusing on the day to day happiness levels decided to apply a longer goal. Causing him to have a purpose in life and apply meaning to his life. She states "That's the power of meaning. Happiness comes and goes. But when life is really good and when things are really bad, having meaning gives you something to hold on to."(Smith, 2017) These points made by Smith points to the possibility that people focus only on happiness because they do not know any other way. The possibility that they have never been exposed to applying meaning to their lives or achieving goals could be causing this focus on unachievable happiness.`

  `This same point is brought up in Avram Alpert article 'The Good-Enough Life' where he discusses how seeing other greatness can cause them to have their own desire to be great. Instead of looking for the meaning in their own lives they focus on greatness which can be an obstacle to their potential. Alpert suggests in his article that a pre-defined life is one that will always be filled with disappointment, instead of defining it you should evolve with life to decide what is "great" and what is just okay. He supports his claims by reviewing several points of view from great thinkers where often the result of greatness is the failure to achieve it and instead forgetting about pre-determined ideas of accomplishment is the best way to live a "good enough life". Saying "If we do manage any of these things, it will not be because we have achieved greatness, but because we have recognized that none of them are achievable until greatness itself is forgotten."( Alpert, 2019) Alpert proposes this idea in order to separate people from thinking that certain ideas are great and that greatness in a whole is so fluid that you can aim for it in life achievement. This idea transitions to the question of what good enough is for some people. When thinking about yourself instead of others you need to determine what personal wellbeing is for you, becuase "we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well-being. It is a completely different notion."()`

  `Pilar Sanjuan, a research professor that focuses on emotion regulation, talks about this in his paper entitled “Affect Balance as Mediating Variable Between Effective Psychological Functioning and Satisfaction with Life”. Where he gives sound evidence about 'well-being' and what causes that well-being. Using Psychological background about well-being along with a study that included over 100 participants. The most important part of the study showed that balance in life mediated the relationships between some positive life attitudes and satisfaction with life. Therefore, reinforcing the idea that having overall meaning in life negates the negative effects of once in a while disappointment. This is a slightly different approach then the other articles to find out what wellbeing, and happiness but it gives sound evidence on what is needed to live that good enough life.`

  `After multiple examples it seems clear that constant focus on happiness is not the way to achieve a good life. Instead applying meaning to your life through goals, and personal relationships allows you to achieve more and have a better life. Emily Esfahani Smith certainly makes this point and by using the support from Avram Alpert, Robert Waldinger, and Pilar Sanjuan we are given a sound idea of what is needed for the human life. No matter what you call wellbeing or happiness it is shown that the constant thought of it will do nothing but hurt your chances of achieving it. So, what are we left with then? Should you constantly focus on other things in a hopeless attempt to achieve something you know nothing about? Well in a nutshell yes. I think Robert Breault sums it up with this quote; "Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things."`

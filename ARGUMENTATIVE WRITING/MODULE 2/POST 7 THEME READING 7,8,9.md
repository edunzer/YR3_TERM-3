## THEME READING 7,8,9

  __NEW INSTRUCTIONS__
    *In this discussion post, I'm asking you to more explicitly try to put these sources into conversation with each other and/or try to see if there are connections you can make that tie certain sources together--attempt to group the readings/speeches into "teams" if you can. Examining how different thinkers approach the same topic from different angles, or to achieve different purposes, is key to developing and understanding your own position on a topic not just "in a vacuum," but as existing "in a conversation" that is already going on around you.*
      `Write a 150-250 word post in which you create one "team" of at least three readings and explain (with examples) how your "team" belong together in some meaningful way.`

    *"Why focus on happiness when goals are more influential." After reading through the 9 articles that we have had so far, I think the most important take away is that happiness is not something you aim for in life. Instead you have to go through life with goals and needs set so that you can progress through your ups and downs of happiness. Then when looking back on your life so far you will not just see those times that you have been sad or unhappy but instead you will see everything that has been accomplished. This idea is brought up in both Emily Esfahani Smith's TED talk 'The Power of Meaning' and in Avram Alperts article 'The Good-Enough Life'. Both these authors state that happiness has been molded into this this false idea of something that can be seen of achieved, when instead happiness is a secondary characteristic of meaningfulness of one’s life. This topic is also brought up in Robert Waldinger's TED talk 'What makes a good life' were a 75-year study showed that personal relationships were a large factor in the achievement in happiness.*

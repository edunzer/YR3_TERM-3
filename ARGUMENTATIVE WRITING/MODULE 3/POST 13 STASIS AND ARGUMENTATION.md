## STASIS AND ARGUMENTATION

  __INSTRUCITONS:__

    *Create a post which the following items (in list form or as individual lines for easy readability for your classmates and me; click here to see a Sample Post (Links to an external site.) of what your post should look like):*

      `Name the topic within/angle on our course theme you're thinking of looking into for the Researched Argument assignment.`

      `Come up with two questions for each category of stasis related to your topic/angle.`

      `Determine which *one* of these categories (and questions) you think is the best starting place at which you can "meet" your audience on your topic. Include a brief explanation as to why you think it is the best category to focus on for your stated topic. Remember: The categories move in a linear fashion--you shouldn't argue procedure if you think your audience doesn't yet accept value. Think carefully on this one.`

      `Test-drive a thesis statement inspired by/stemming from your focus question. One way to make a strong thesis statement is to give a highly specific answer to the invention question you chose in step 3.`

      `Come back the day after the post due date to view your classmates' thesis statements and give them feedback on their posts, and later to read the feedback you receive on your own.`


  __ASSINGMENT:__

    *My Topic:* Happiness and Meaningfulness

    *Stasis Questions:*

      *Fact/Conjecture:*
        `Should happiness be focused on in life? Or should meaningfulness be more important?`

      *Definition:*
        `Can the over focus on happiness halt there ability to actaully acheive it? Can the lack of meaningfulness have the same effect of being un happy?`

      *Quality/Value:*
        `Is the lack of knowledge about happiness a huge factor on why so many people dont know how to judge it? Does the lack of meaning in life cause someone to focus only on small moments of happiness and saddness? `

      *Policy/Procedure:*
        `Should people be taught more about happiness through there early lifes to better those lives? Should parents encourage there kids to find something important in there lives so they know where to go? `

    *My Stasis Focus:*
      `I think because most poeple still focus on happiness in life instead of meaningfulness its important that I start at Fact/Conjecture. This will enable me to give a well rounded approach to why happiness and meaningfulness are two very seperate things and that meaningfulness is much more important. `

    *My "Test" Thesis:*
      `The lack of knowledge about happiness and the ways to have a good life cause people to view brief momements of happiness and saddness as there entire life; and therefore having negative effects on there view of life. `

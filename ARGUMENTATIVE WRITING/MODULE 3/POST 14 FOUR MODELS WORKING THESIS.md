## FOUR MODELS FOR FORMULATING A WORKING THESIS

  __INSTRUCITONS__

    *Review the "Steps to Formulating a Working Thesis: Four Models" on page 146 of our course textbook (and any preceding pages for more detail on each model).*

    *Follow steps 1-3 of "A Practice Sequence: Building a Thesis" on page 158 of our course textbook, answering the questions/prompts with 2-4 sentences or so each to help you establish meaningful context for your thesis.*

      Have you established that your issue is current and relevant, that it is or should be on peopleâ€™s minds?  What information would you need to do so?

        `I think this issue is very relevant today, and will continue to be relevant as people continue on the go to college then get a job and thats it path. This often results in people thinking there life is terrible because all they think about is how work sucks or they have nothing to do.`

      Can you summarize briefly what others have said in the past to show that you are familiar with how others have addressed the issue? List some of the key texts you have read and the key points they make.

        `1. Emily Esfahani Smith's TED talk The Power of Meaning states that there is more to life than being happy, and that the pursuit of happiness almost always ends in the opposite. She suggests in her talk that happiness is the unachievable fantasy that we often aim for, when in reality it is better to focus on the meaning of your life.`

        `2. Avram Alperts article The Good-Enough Life discusses how seeing other greatness can cause them to have their own desire to be great. Instead of looking for the meaning in their own lives they focus on greatness which can be an obstacle to their potential. Alpert suggests in his article that a pre-defined life is one that will always be filled with disappointment, instead of defining it you should evolve with life to decide what is "great" and what is just okay.`

        `3. Pilar Sanjuan, a research professor that focuses on emotion regulation, talks about this in his paper entitled Affect Balance as Mediating Variable Between Effective Psychological Functioning and Satisfaction with Life. Where he gives sound evidence about 'well-being' and what causes that well-being.`

      Have you identified any misunderstandings or gaps in how others have addressed the issue? Describe them. Do you have any ideas or information that would address these misunderstandings or help fill the gaps?  Where might you find the information you need?  Can you think of any sources you should reread to learn more?

        `I think the biggest problem with this issue is that there really is no dictonary defitions for happiness and meaningfulness. This creates a problem when someone is trying to understand why happiness is something that cant be achieve in life. The larger issue that is often brough up is that no one is the same and this makes creating those defintions impossible to define and therefore exsplain this. Because of this I choose multiple sources and authors that give examples of what well being and happiness is in life. Along with a exaplation of meaning.`

      At this point, what is your take on the issue? Try drafting a working thesis statement that will present readers with something new to think about building on and extending what others have argued.

        `Misinterpretations model: Although multiple authors state that happiness is very important and that having it will help lenghthen your life, a better examination suggests that happiness is often only acheived after the application of meaning. `

        `Gap model: Although multiple authors have noted that personal relationships are the key to a happy life, they have missed the importance of the meaning that relationships put into ones life.   `

        `Modification model: Although I do agree with many authors that happiness is important to life and that it is acheived through personal relationships, it is important to state that having personal relationships is actually applying meaning to ones life rather then just making it more happy.`

        `Hypothesis-testing model: Some people explain happiness by suggesting its key to have personal relationships, but a close analysis of the problem reveals that there are multiple explantions like having meaning, purpose, and goals to aim for. `

    *Continue to step 4 of "A Practice Sequence: Building a Thesis," and write one thesis statement for each of the four models given. Note that each model is accompanied by a template; I encourage you to use the template like a "Mad Libs" for your thinking, plugging in the names of specific authors where the template says "scholars" and specific claims of the authors and yourself in the relevant "A," "B," and "C" portions of the templates.*

    *Return to this forum the day after the posting due date to give feedback to at least two of your peers's posts. Let them know if they've really captured an idea well (or gently correct any misunderstandings), if one of their thesis statements seems particularly strong, etc.*

    *Return later in the week to get your feedback on your own statements.*

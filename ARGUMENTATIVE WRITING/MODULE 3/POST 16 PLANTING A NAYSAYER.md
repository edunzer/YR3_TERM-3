    *Write four sentences--each using a different template from each of the four categories of templates above--in which you engage with naysayers to the argument you are working on for your final essay.*

  __ASSIGNMENT:__

    *Template for Entertaining Objections:*

      `Of course, many will probably disagree on the grounds that happiness is not a relevent measure in ones life, and dismiss the information from supporting authors that meanging and goals are more important.`

      `This could be a good way to challenge the reader into becoming more involved in the text. Often when you say that someone cant except something they try harder to see that side of the arguement.`

    *Template for Naming Your Naysayers:*

      `Here, many past generations would certainly take issue with the argument that happiness is not fundamental in the question of how to have a good life.`

      `I might use this as it shows how new the conversasion is, and how its harder to get poeple to change from there old methods. `

    *Template for Introducing Objections Informally:*

      `But is this proposal realistic? Given that there is no real defintion or instruction on how to acheive a good life how can you really argue one method being better then the other?`

      `I dont think ill use this template as it completely takes away all arguements that can be given. `

    *Templates for Making Concessions While Still Standing Your Ground:*

      `Although I gratn that happiness is a metirc by which somoene can guage there life, I still maintain that meaning allows for better descions and achievement of that good life.`

      `I think this approach will allow me to connect more with the readers that are hesitent with giving up happiness. Instead it suggests that instead of giving it up you just use it secondarly and therefore will make it easier to connect with those readers.`

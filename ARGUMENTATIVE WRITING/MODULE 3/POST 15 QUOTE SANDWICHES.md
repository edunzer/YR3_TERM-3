    `Some people explain happiness by suggesting its key to have personal relationships, but a close analysis of the problem reveals that there are multiple explantions like having meaning, purpose, and goals to aim for. Author Emily Esfahani Smith's belives in this same issue and states that our over focus on happiness leads to our downfall. In a 2017 TED talk Smith says "I used to think the whole purpose of life was pursuing happiness. …  But instead of ever feeling fulfilled, I felt anxious and adrift."(Smith 2017) Like most of americans she thought that happiness was what controled your life, and not knowing anything else she tried to achieve it. Not until here 30s did she look in a different direction and finally find something that can be achieved based on your own needs, meaning. She goes on to state that "Happiness comes and goes. But when life is really good and when things are really bad, having meaning gives you something to hold on to." (Smith 2017) These points made by Smith suggest the possibility that people focus only on happiness because they do not know any other way. The possibility that they have never been exposed to applying meaning to their lives or achieving goals could be causing this focus on unachievable happiness.`

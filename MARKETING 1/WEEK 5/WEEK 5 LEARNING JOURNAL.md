## WEEK 5 LEARNING JOURNAL

  __SUBJECT:__ *The important factors of product marketing and development*

    *First Takeaway*
      `My first Takeaway is about brand association and how it can have a huge effect on a product line. This is one of the most interesting parts of marketing for me as it’s something that I often think about when buying products. The way a company puts itself out there to the public is extremely influential and often has an immediate effect on the purchasing of that public. For me personally the look of a package and the limited number of forced ads that show their logo has a huge effect on whether I want to by their product. Often times the clean cut ad or the simple box gets my attention more because it has been conditioned in my mind to be a brand that doesn’t waste as much money on marketing and instead spends in on their product.`

    *Second Takeaway*
      `My second Takeaway is how much testing and feedback is needed to create a good product. Although I knew this, I found it very interesting to see how the different tests and creation of ideas revolve around the customer. It really makes me think about how some companies are not testing enough and should really be taking advantage of how much customers want to speak their mind about a product.`

    *Third Takeaway*
      `My third Takeaway is about how a brand should evolve over time. As shown in the slide notes google has changed their logo every 5 or 10 years in order to move with the new styles and designs that people like. This factor is very important to a company as it defines whether they are trying to get new customers that like the new styles or continue getting old customers that like that old style. A prime example of not changing is how some companies have picked older styles to give their target customers (older people) a sense that this brand is like them. Not adapting and changing makes it seem more familiar to that customer. But for newer generations this logo might seem off putting and will discourage them. The inverse can be true as well.  `

    *Fourth Takeaway*
      `My Fourth Takeaway is about goods vs services and how its extremely important for a company to know what category they are in. After looking through the information it became very clear that in order to succeed in either category you need to know the failing points or draw backs and how to overcome them. If you try and market your product as a good but it’s really a service, you will not be prepared for what can happen to your customers and their likelihood of coming back. `

    *Fifth Takeaway*
      `My fifth Takeaway has to do with Core vs value-added. I found this extremely interesting as I had never thought about putting the two things into a category. After reading through it makes a huge amount of sense. The core of a product is the product itself, but the added value of that product often relates to the experience and image that you have. For example, my experience at a local Wells Fargo was extremely good after I not only received the service that I wanted (setting up a CD account) but also because the service itself and the experience was enjoyable. This added to the core service that I went for. `

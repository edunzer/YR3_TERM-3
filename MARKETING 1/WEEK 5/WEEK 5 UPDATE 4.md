This NPR article covers the new type of app that could start to take over essential services around the world.

As stated in many news articles all over the internet no one was prepared for COVID-19, and really no one is prepared for any situation that involves a huge influx of people doing something entirely different then their normal routine. This is where the problem lies.

Eleanor Beardsley writes about a new company that has completely changes the way that France is dealing with its population that needs medical assistance. Covidom is the apps name and they are taking an entirely new approach to how essential services should distribute their product, aka healthcare assistance. As stated above the influx of people needing assistance has created a problem where hospitals could be overrun by people, whether they actually need medical attention or not. So as a solution this app was created to connect patients and doctors along with healthcare professionals. This creates the much-needed distance that COVID preparation is requiring along with limiting the hospitals from being overrun and failing in critical areas.

The App in a whole has very simple functions. First the hospitals connect the patients to the app and then they are put into categories based on their needs. This allows certain doctors to be assigned and check on them at different intervals. It is very similar to a hospital’s environment but just over the phone and organized in a more effective manner. The ability to record number of active cases and the status has greatly improved healthcare response and knowledge of the virus along with educating the public.

"It's actually transformed people's perception of when they should go to the emergency room," he says. "They realize they can stay at home in security."

This new type of app could start a new trend in the tech world where outside companies will create functioning application on their own dime that work effectively and then government agencies will purchase them. This process is already in the works for the Covidom App and could be very useful in other applications as well.

My Opinion: Similar technology and product development will start to explode for similar situation such as the one outlined in the article. A huge problem with hospitals, DMV, etc. are that when there is an influx of people there is no measures in place to help. Also, there is two categories of people the ones that actually need help now and then the ones that just do not know the answer to a question and came because they didn’t know anywhere else to go. Applications that make it easier to answer questions from citizens for essential parts of life without having to go somewhere will greatly improve situations where there is a huge influx of people.

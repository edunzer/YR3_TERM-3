## MARKETING UPDATE 2

*About the marketing update project*

  `Choose one topic from among the hundreds presented in our course material and prepare a one-page memo. The update should be aligned with one of the four Ps of marketing (Product, Price, Place, or Promotion). Each update should summarize (summarize DOES NOT mean cut and paste the abstract - this would be plagiarism) the main points of the article along with your own opinion of the subject. The articles should be appropriately cited using a commonly accepted format such as MLA or APA.`

  `The written memo is expected to be your highest quality work. Particular attention should be paid to commonly accepted grammar, spelling, punctuation, sentence structure, paragraph structure etc.`

  `In addition to the written update, please share your findings as part of your weekly learning journal.`

*Grading*

  `Content depth and fit- the paper has both the summary and your opinion and is related to a marketing topic. If you aren't sure about a topic, send me an email and ask if it's a good topic.`

  `Grammar and spelling- the paper is free of errors as described above. Use the Online Writing Lab: https://techweb.oit.edu/students/peer-consulting/online-writing-lab`

  `Quality of source- peer-reviewed journal articles are ideal (example: Journal of Marketing). Well-known periodicals/websites such as Ad Age, Harvard Business Review, and NPR are acceptable- you won't lose points for these. Sources that are of questionable or difficult-to-verify authority should not be used and may result in a deduction of points. If you aren't sure, send me an email and ask if it's a god source.`

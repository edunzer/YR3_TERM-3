## MARKETING UPDATE 2

*About the marketing update project*

  `Choose one topic from among the hundreds presented in our course material and prepare a one-page memo. The update should be aligned with one of the four Ps of marketing (Product, Price, Place, or Promotion). Each update should summarize (summarize DOES NOT mean cut and paste the abstract - this would be plagiarism) the main points of the article along with your own opinion of the subject. The articles should be appropriately cited using a commonly accepted format such as MLA or APA.`

  `The written memo is expected to be your highest quality work. Particular attention should be paid to commonly accepted grammar, spelling, punctuation, sentence structure, paragraph structure etc.`

  `In addition to the written update, please share your findings as part of your weekly learning journal.`

*Grading*

  `Content depth and fit- the paper has both the summary and your opinion and is related to a marketing topic. If you aren't sure about a topic, send me an email and ask if it's a good topic.`

  `Grammar and spelling- the paper is free of errors as described above. Use the Online Writing Lab: https://techweb.oit.edu/students/peer-consulting/online-writing-lab`

  `Quality of source- peer-reviewed journal articles are ideal (example: Journal of Marketing). Well-known periodicals/websites such as Ad Age, Harvard Business Review, and NPR are acceptable- you won't lose points for these. Sources that are of questionable or difficult-to-verify authority should not be used and may result in a deduction of points. If you aren't sure, send me an email and ask if it's a god source.`

  Subject: APPLE MAKES FACE SHIELDS AND TESLA SHOWS VENTILATOR MADE FROM AUTO PARTS: MONDAY WAKE-UP CALL (PRODUCT/PROMOTION)
  Date: 4/6/20

  This Ad age article details the many large companies, Apple and Tesla, in particular that are pivoting there production to medical equipment amid the Covid-19 crisis.

  Alexandra Jardine the author of this article enlightens the reader about big changes that are coming out of Apple. Saying that after a recent media post apple has started to design face sheilds for medical workers and has sourced 20 million masks through supply chains. Along with assigning apple personel to packageing and operations teams inorder to get the sheilds made and shipped. The company stated that they are planning on shipping a million a week in order to supply the front lines.

  This big business pivote in product creations is getting more and more traction as companies are starting to get publicity and positive results after reaching out to people in need. Telsa is just one of the many companies that has changed there engineering teams to the task of ventilator creation after the shortages that have hit hot spot areas.

  This new promtoional strategy not only aims to help people in need, but also aims to show that large companies are willing to take matters into there own hands when a crisis insues.

  My Opinion: After seeing mulitple news articles detailing this new type of business outreach I think we can only exspect more to come. After businesses start to gain more traction from there heroic good deads I think the increase in advertising for there deads will overwhelm the consumer.

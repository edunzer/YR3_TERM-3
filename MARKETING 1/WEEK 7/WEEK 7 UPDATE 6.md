Date: 5/20/20

This NPR article details the new change in where consumers are buying there products from target. Along with a potential spike in long term online buying habits for a company that was never seen as a online retailer.

Since Target has remained open during the COVID-19 pandemic, they have had a surge in demand online. An normal April day comparable to a Cyber Monday sale according to Alina Selyukh the writer of this article. Saying that about 5 million people shopped on Target's website for the first time in the past three months and Target's online sales jumped 141% from a year earlier.

Selyukh says that Target relied on its physical stores to fill 80% of online sales, and the CEO stated them as "vitally important" even in the face of massive online-shopping growth. The company said demand for its same-day services, like pickup of online purchases at stores have nearly tripled in the first quarter, which ended May 2.


OPINION: This spick in online shopping is no shock concidering the events that are taking place but what is interesting is that a company that seemed to have limited online sales has grown over night. This might be thanks to the limited avaiblilty that amazon briefly had during the COVID-19 crisis. The longer shipping times and halted business seems to be turning customers away from the online shopping king and onto typical instore retailers.

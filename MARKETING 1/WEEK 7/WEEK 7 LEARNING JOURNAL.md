## WEEK 7 LEARNING JOURNAL

  __SUBJECT:__ *Promotion in a digital world*

  *First Takeaway*
    `My first Takeaway is from the 'What evolution tells us about advertising' video. The most interesting point about advertising is that it is a way to communicate the unseen. Now although this is obvious to some end when you think about it ive never really thought about it this way. To me most advertising is just trying to sell a product in a way that makes the customer want it. But for a lot of ads the subtle details are what convey the most to the customer.`

  *Second Takeaway*
    `My second Takeaway is from the goal models (cognition, affect, behavior). Theses goals are very important but cognition being the most important to most brands that dont have the automatic recognition that NIKE, INTEL, etc. have. Cognition becomes increasingly important with the amount of options that are out there because when a customer wants to buy a new kitchen appliance you would want your brand name to be through into the mix. Getting that idea in the customers head is one of the most challenging things. As a consumer ive always thought that there are tons of much better products out there but because i dont fit the model for there ideal customer i have no cognition of that company. `

  *Third Takeaway*
    `My third Takeaway is about endorsement ads. This is a very interesting way of promotion to me because the process of endorsement can either show that the product is great or its terrible. Now its obvious that if a well known scientist endorses a product and knows alot about the product and how to represent it then its good. But on the other hand if they seem to only being "endorsing" it because they are getting payed the it gives a negative effect of that company/product. For me personally i often look through the first ad endorsement and look toward the endorser to see if they actually use the product in the ways that are stated.`

  *Fourth Takeaway*
    `My Fourth Takeaway is from the 'How brands can benefit from social media analytics' video. Although this video details how to use the social media analytics i think its important to note that analytics systems like this are not well known to people outside of marketing and business management. Most people dont know that most social media company's or application companies actually have separate businesses that rely on selling data about human behavior. Most of promotion now days is no longer a study of people in a room being asked questions. Instead you just buy information from companies like twitter who have an entire business that sells behavioral information.`

  *Fifth Takeaway*
    `My fifth Takeaway is about the Reach, Frequency, and GRP's. These three topics are very important metrics for measuring promotion to a customer. Reach details the percentage of your targets that have seen your ad. Frequency shows the average number of times a target saw the ad within a certain time period, and GRP is a metric to measure your reach and frequency. Knowing how to track your ad data and represent it is a key part of knowing your customer and planning on what you need to advertise next. `

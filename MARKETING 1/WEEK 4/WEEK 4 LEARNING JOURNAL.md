## WEEK 4 LEARNING Journal

  __SUBJECT:__ *Understanding how positioning can help*

    *First Takeaway*
      `My first takeaway was positioning, and how important it is to finding a niche for your product and how you conduct your promotion of that product. Knowing where you are in the market place can have a huge impact on what your targeting of customers should be like, and how you should be targeting compared to your competitors.`

    *Second Takeaway*
      `My second takeaway is about the positioning statement. I found this very interesting as it really takes the key factors of your positioning and compresses it into the key aspects. By making a positioning statement you understand some of the most important factors and allows you to see more clearly.`

    *Third Takeaway*
      `My third takeaway is the positioning matrix or perceptual map. I found this very interesting as I had never heard of it before and it seemed to be a great way to present different companies and their position in a market. For me personally it’s so much easier to see information in a visual state rather than dry numbers so this new style was a great help to understand positioning more and how customers can be in certain categories. `

    *Fourth Takeaway*
      `My fourth takeaway is about law 17 'unpredictability'. I think this was a huge part of the laws of marketing as it outlines the fact that you can’t just know what other companies are going to do. In order to compete with them you have to make educated guesses based on past events or you have to be second and just react to what they are doing. This also translates into other companies that do something crazy in order to surprise their competition which either fails or relates into law 20 'hype'. `

    *Fifth Takeaway*
      `My fifth takeaway is about law 1 'leadership'. After seeing this in the video it really magnified the idea that I have had in my mind about apple. The fact that apple is the "best" tech company out there right now seems to be because they were there first. They were the first to make a good smartphone, and despite their newer phones being overpriced crap they still have a hold on a huge chunk of the market. This is largely to do with rule 1 and the fact that they have built a culture for their products where other options are seen to be impossible because apple products fail to work with other devices.`

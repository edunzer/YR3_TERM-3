Subject: MCDONALD’S LAUNCHES A NEW CAMPAIGN TO PROMOTE FREE FOOD FOR FIRST RESPONDERS (PROMOTION)
Date: 4/29/20


This Ad Age article covers the new style of promotion and marketing for one of the largest companies McDonalds and there new advertising methods to capture the hearts of customers along with showing they care.

According to a McDonalds spokesperson the company will be devoting the next couple weeks of advertising to there "Thank You Meals" which aim to support the first responders that are currently working so hard. The advertisement shows that all first responders will be eating free at all McDonalds locations as we continue through this Covid-19 crisis.

One of the ads will be putting a nostalgic twist on the current overabundance advertising, showing childhood photos of current first responders having a birthday party or a meal at McDonald’s, before showing the first responders in their current uniforms.

Now whether this is a truly selfless act is debatable. To me it seems that McDonald’s is playing catch up with all the companies that are trying to prove that they care about their customers during this pandemic. The very fact that they are showing so much advertising of the subject goes to show that they want to jump in and get good publicity after the truly selfless small chains started the trend.

The push comes as fast food chains, in particular McDonald’s as it is the largest food chain, have faced backlash about staying open during a time when the nation is largely shut down, and for possibly putting customers and workers at risk. In order to combat this McDonalds has been working on getting protective gear to all restaurants and has been putting new workplace processes in place.

My Opinion: Although it seems the company is taking appropriate measures to ensure some safety it’s not without warrant to say that the company still puts profit over total protection of their customers. This new ad blitz is just another way to distract their customers from the real issues and instill the idea that the big company cares about them as individuals.

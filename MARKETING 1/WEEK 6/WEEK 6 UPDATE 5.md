This NPR article goes through the new polices and product changes that Twitter has made recently in the light of false COVID-19 information.

Bobby Allyn the author of this article states that Twitter is now labeling misleading or unverified tweets about the coronavirus. Even going as far as removing content it believes could lead to harm. These labels are used to warn the users about the misinformation but not go as far as deleting the content.

The article also states that Twitter officials have found that users do not want the company to decide which messages are truthful, but they do desire context around tweets. As such, Twitter will not remove content that is misleading or false as long as it does not lead to direct harm. Tweets that are flagged with this new label will also be prevented from trending in order to stop their false information from reaching others.

Other tweets that are considered harmful but not posing an imminent health risk will be covered up with a warning saying the tweets conflict with health experts. The user is then shown a link for expert information or they can choose to view the tweet.

The goal of twitter is to better their services by make it easy to find credible information on twitter and limit the spread of potentially harmful and misleading content. This is also a new goal of other social media sites like Facebook and Google that have also helped stop misinformation with similar methods.

OPINION:
Now this is a great move for twitter to show that they care about what information is being put out to the world, especially since so many people now think that twitter is a "reputable" place for information. But what this also creates is a huge problem for their social media platform product. After all this was meant to be a free place where anyone can say what they want and by taking away from that despite the information not being true it is changing what the platform used to represent. A lot of people are going to see this recent change as a positive and a negative. And the ones that see the negative are going to have a changing view of the twitter product.

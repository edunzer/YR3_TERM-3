## WEEK 6 LEARNING JOURNAL

__SUBJECT:__ *How pricing can be nothing close to the actual cost of the product*

  *First Takeaway*
    `My first Takeaway is from the "how marketing impacts distribution channels" video. I found it extremely helpful and interesting to know more about how the availability of a product can greatly effect the end choice. A main point was made that 50% of the choice was at the store and relied on it being in front of the consumer. Also I found it extremely interesting at how other popular brands help there competitors just because they are an option on the shelf. Which brings in more people even if they donâ€™t pick that product.`

  *Second Takeaway*
    `My second Takeaway is from the "Why The Price Of Coca-Cola Didn't Change For 70 Years" video. This was a very interesting point about how companies can trap themselves with marketing promises. The fact that extremely popular brands basically set the standard for pricing is extremely interesting to me. For example apple is one of the most outrageous prices in the business, there phones are often $100-$200 above what they should be. Now if android phones did this first there would have bene outrage, because android has been seen as the lower end of phones and therefore better bang for your buck. But as soon as apple started to raise there prices so did android companies like Samsung. Both phones are currently $200 more then they should be but they have used each other to stop the outrage over prices. `

  *Third Takeaway*
    `My third Takeaway is about elasticity and pricing. This was a great point I think about how demand can cause everyone to throw everything else out the window. This was seen recently with toilet paper and other things that were thought to be running out. If prices went up this would be an inelastic example where price has nothing to do with units sold. Obviously the normal curve is the higher the price the less sold. But it does go to show that price is only a secondary factor when the demand is extremely high. `

  *Fourth Takeaway*
    `My Fourth Takeaway is about elasticity again but instead how customer segments relate to it. According to the graph the more brand loyal a customer the more they are willing to pay for a product. This of course makes sense but I found it very interesting to think that brands have this idea where they can make there customer more and more reliant on there product and continue raising the price. Apple comes to mind of course, since there entire device lineup and software focuses on entrapping the consumer into only being able to use there products and not others. `

  *Fifth Takeaway*
    `My fifth Takeaway is about price sensitivity which I find to be the most important when thinking about pricing an item. Since a company can obviously charge more for a product if there is brand loyalty then its important to know how much a customer cares about the brand. Or if they consider the product a luxury item, or if they will look to other substitutes if the price is too high. knowing all this could help the brand find the perfect price where they could possibility be charging more then they were before. `

## WEEK 8 LEARNING JOURNAL

__SUBJECT:__ *How the customer changes the product*

*First Takeaway*
  `My first Takeaway is from the "Kittu Kitsu Case study", which detailed how a product loved by a certain culture was able to climb even higher and position itself as part of a culture. Much like McDonalds is known as a U.S. company and product kit kats are known in japan as a favorite among its people. But the company went even farther and actually positioned itself as a product that is known as a thank you message, or a good luck message among the japanese people. This not only increased the brand awareness but also made kit kats image even better then it was in a country that already had a high opinion of it.`

*Second Takeaway*
  `My second Takeaway is from the "Where to find japaness kitkats in tokyo" and how the representation of a product is different in different cultures. Now it is obvious that in japan products are presented in a totally different way then in other countries, but there is also a huge difference that is about the actual product. There are tons of different kinds but it seems that the different appeareance actually try and connect with the customer. Some of the packages present kitkats like a present that you should buy for someone else. This goes with the customers opinion of what kitkat represents and how it is a japaness favorite that means more then just candy. `

*Third Takeaway*
  `My third Takeaway is about how much information you need to obtain from the customer in order to get good information to market to them correctly. This can include customer satisfaction, quality opinions, repurchase intentions and whether or not the customer will give word of mouth. `

*Fourth Takeaway*
  `My Fourth Takeaway is about customer experience and involvment of that customer. As shown in the power point both of these have a huge impact on the company customer relationship. There are many different meanings to the customer experience that can effect whether they will buy again or not. Also there is a big difference betwene what type of involvement the customer has with the purchase. Low envolvement often doesnt put much thought into the evaluation and the expectations arent developed enough to warent a good result. Higher involvement is the opposite and has much more sway when geting evaluations and expectations back. `

*Fifth Takeaway*
  `My fifth Takeaway is about where a customers expectiations can come from. There are 4 categories personal experience, friends and experts, marketing mix elements, and thrid party communication. These all have different levels of trust, along with how much they will sway the customer into what they will expect and therefore get. Often times personal and freiends/experts have the most pole and therefore can help the most when it comes to word of mouth.  `

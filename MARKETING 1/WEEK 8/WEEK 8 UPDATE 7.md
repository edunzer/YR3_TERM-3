This NPR article by Lynsey Jeffery show the veritility of some major companies and how the COVID-19 crisis has spurred most to pivote to a new product line.

In her article Jeffery details the biggest change that many retailers are currently going through. The switch to selling the hottest product on the mark for consumers, masks. This pivote has of course been spurred on by the crisis but it also goes to show how unprepared companies and its customers are.

For example this type of product is no surprise in china considering they have the worst pollution in the world mask were a popular item before the crisis ocrrured. But now that there is a reason for them in the US sales and production have both increased by a huge margin. Now the masks are something that almost everyone needs and the increase desire for styles and brand name looks are at a high as well.

Etsy a large online retailer that premotes small business owners to sell there product on there site has seen a huge jump in sales as there were no large clothing retailers selling masks for a large period of time. Jeffery quotes the CEO saying "In April alone, the site grossed more than $130 million in face mask sales, according to the presentation." (Jeffery 2020)

This new product not only has opened up a new market in the US for retailers but also has encouraged companies to gain good publicity through the sales and dontation that are related to masks. Jeffery says that "Many brands are also using the worldwide demand for face masks as an opportunity to build positive engagement by making charitable donations of their face mask sales."

Opinion: This new change in product is no surprise but what will be interesting is if companies produce and have a huge stock pile that is unwanted if this crisis ends abrubly. As stated above companies are scrambling to get masks and sell them but when will they stop. And will people continue to buy these new stylish masks after the crisis is over? The possability of it becoming fashinable like in china is very possible for large cities like LA or NewYork where the density causes people to be more vigilant.

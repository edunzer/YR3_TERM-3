This Harvard Business Review article by Eddie Yoon details the huge shift in product purchasing habitats that are occuring becuase the of the COVID-19 crisis.

In his article Yoon talks about how the one of the largest shifts in consumer habits has happened in the last couple months. This shift has been related to people isolating themselves due to the virus of course but more importantly it has changed the way people are acting. Yoon states in his article that the "cooking superconsumers"(Yoon, 2020), a term he developed from a past article about people who love to cook and purchase food around cooking, have increased. Saying that originally they had "shrunk by a third over 20 years to just 10% of the U.S. population."(Yoon, 2020) This of course was sparked by a trend of people going out more and eating. But now that the self isolation has happened "54% of Americans are cooking more than they were before the pandemic, and 35% say they “enjoy cooking more now than ever.”" (Yoon, 2020)

This huge spike in grouth presents a whole new frontier for businesses, more specifically food orientated ones. Now that peopele are taking up cooking again what will the consumer want? And will the businesses be able to keep up with this grouth. As shown by resent problems with food shortages grocery stores are not equipped for a huge increase in cusomers wanting to buy a weeks worth of meals. Yoon says that "If the number of cooking enthusiasts triples and stays there, it will have ramifications." (Yoon, 2020) Although this scenario is unlikely there are a few factors that will specifically effect what happens.

Yoon gives three factors that will largely have an effect this new trend. First is working from home, and frankly this is big one. According to Yoon "Cooking is correlated with time spent at home, and working at home is likely to permanently increase post-Covid."(Yoon, 2020) This means that the more people that couse to stay at home and work will most likely be cooking for themselves or atleast spending more time purchasing food for there household. Next there is the continued growth of the single person household. "The benefits of cooking dramatically differ if you’re cooking for one versus many. Cooking for one person is inconvenient and not as cost effective as cooking in bulk." (Yoon, 2020) This will also change the purchasing habits of the consumer, whether they are buying every day or they are doing a weeks worth of shopping in one day. Lastly there is the increased likelyhood that people wont want to be in dense buildings. By this I mean in close-corders with other poeple. This has not only magnified during the COVID crisis but was slowly becoming popular thanks to major businesses like Amazon and Walmart that offer shipping or outside store pickup. For reference delivery could become the new market, and online ordering will be the norm more so then it already is.

OPINION:
Because of resent events I think people will change there behvaior. Dinning out will be restricted to the people that have no idea how to cook for themselves and are probably weathier then others. Online ordering will continue to grow and businesses that already have online ordering will thrive more then those who do not. Overall I think this will be caused by people just getting used to not being in close proximity to others. I dont think people will be afraid to go out becuase of resent events but they will have just been used to ordering food, or cooking for themelves. Online food retailers like Freshly will probably contine to expand and grow due to poeples revised interest in cooking.

## INTRODUCTION

__Assignment:__

  `Hi! My name is Ethan Dunzer. I am a junior at Oregon tech, and I am studying Information and Technology. I just transferred from Oregon State Cascades and I am very happy to be a degree that interests me as much as Information and Technology. (This is a key to my happiness)`

  `As far as information about me, I grew up in Lake Oswego (Portland) and moved to Bend 3 years ago but am hoping to move back as soon as possible. I love the rain (again happiness) and multiple seasons that Portland has. If you are thinking of moving to bend just be prepared for the strange weather. There are only 2 seasons really, SUPER cold and long winters and then the switch flips to HOT summers.`

  `After college I’m hoping to get a job in web development or email marketing as that is what I am most interested in, but I am open to all different options. My skills have a wide range from computer hardware and programming to car repair and house building. I look forward to this class and hope to gain a lot of new knowledge that I can use in a future career.`

  `The keys to my happiness are small things that make life interesting. Most people complain that they are just doing the same things over and over again; going to work, coming home, and sleeping. So when I feel down or like I’m stuck in a rut simple things like talking to someone about an interesting topic or watching a movie that you have always like can help improve that same old same old that you have been stuck in.`

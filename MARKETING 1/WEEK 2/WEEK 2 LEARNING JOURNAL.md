## WEEK 2 LEARNING JOURNAL

  __SUBJECT:__ *How value is set through marketing techniques.*

    *First takeaway*
      `My first takeaway has to do with Rory Sitherlands TED talk. Throughout the talk Sitherlands gave example after example of product that had no material value but where given  intrinsic value or "fake value" inorder to market the product better. Now I knew this before and I bet most poeple do but what took me by surpise was the fact of how easy it was to associate product with fake value. Or rather not how easy it was but instead how easy it was to get the consumers to beleive it. Simple status was such a huge factor in past time and still is today but just to not a degree. It amazes me that there is so little thought put into the marterials used in a product today.`

    *Second takeaway*
      `My second takeaway was from The Jame experiement. This was a facinating topic as I had recently watched a TED talk about the very same topic of choice for a different class. It was great to see the topic put into a marketing and sale context as I was previously thinking about choice as a personal/life delema. In the other article I read one of the main points was how choice differs among countries of origin. This made me think about how product marketing would change between location and if the same jam experiemtn would differ in other countries.`

    *Third takeaway*
      `My third takeaway was the 3P's or the purchasing process. I think we can all agree that pre-purchase and purchase were both defintions that the common person thinks of whether your in marketing or not. But what I did find very interesting is the post-purchase part. I often forget about this part when going through the different aspects of marketing. But it seems that post-purchase is an exstremely important part of marketing because it relates to the customers satisfaction. And as we all know the keeping of a customer for a business is a huge portion of marketing.`

    *Fourth takeaway*
      `My fourth takeaway was the three typoes of consumer purchases. This one wasnt so much of knew information as it makes sense when I think about purchasing habits but rather eye opening. I had never seen them actually categorized before into different classes. But it is very apparent that distingishing a product as part of the 3 categories could be very benefital to the marketing and sale of that product. `

    *Fifth takeaway*
      `My fifth takeaway was again to do with the different types of purchasing. I found it exstremely interesting to see the key differences between high and low involvment purchases. The fact that price had such a low impact on high involvemtn purchases was shocking. It almost seems that low involvement only only consideres price as the motive to buy, and high involvment means that the customer is so intent on the brand name that price is no longer a deciding factor.`

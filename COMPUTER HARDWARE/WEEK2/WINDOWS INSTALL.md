  __Questions to answer:__

    *What differences do you notice between installing a Windows Desktop OS like Windows 10 vs. a Windows Versions that you may have used before (or any other operating system that you have prior experience with)?*

      `Deliverable(s): I think the most obvious think is user error solutions when compared to a linux OS. By this I mean the protection of user so that they dont mess it up and do something entirely wrong. After installing mulitple different linux OS's it was very apparent that there were limited protections in place. Alot of options werent decided for you like they are in windows. For example hard drive partitioning options and file instalation lonctations. Instead windows just asks you what drive you want to install on and and off you go.`

    *What are some common applications that you expect organizations will run on Windows 10?*

      `Deliverable(s): First things are web browsers, then you have basic file editors (the miscrosoft suite), more complicated applications like adobe programs, then there are hardcore file editors (code editors). But most of the applications that are used on windows are designed for windows or mac.`

    *What are some of the advantages and / or disadvantages to running an operating system like Windows 10 in a Virtual Machine (VM)?*

      `Deliverable(s): Well the most important is the abilty to run mulitple kinds of OS in the same device. I know for web devlepment you need to have different environments inorder to make sure your code/software works on all the devices it is offered on.`

      `Along with having mulitple OS's you can run software that is only avaible one a certain OS. Apple comes to mind, considering that there are plenty of app devlepment softwares that are only avaible on MAC OS's. `

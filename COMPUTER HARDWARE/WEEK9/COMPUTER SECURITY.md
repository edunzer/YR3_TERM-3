## COMPUTER SECURITY

  __Questions:__

    *What is one of your first considerations (based on your research) when determining which security options are best for your: PC / laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.?*
      There are 5 practices that I actively use along with believe in. 1st is  using user authenticaion, this means turning on password, passcode, face ID, or touch ID on your device. 2nd is updating the opterating system regularly in order to patch holes that are open to hackers, along with other security gaps. 3rd Avoid public wifi to prevent hackers or the organizations network from accessing your device. 4th use a password manager. Now this is ofcourse an option because you could just have lots of different passwords but the idea is that you need a new password for everything so the only possible way to remeber them all is by using a manager. 5th enable remote lock and remote wipe on devices that could be stolen or left somewhere.

    *When thinking about security across your devices (PCs, tablets / laptops / phones, etc.) what considerations do you have toward performance?*
      Personally I dont have any security methods like malware detection softwares like norton or mcafee because they have a huge impact on performance. The constant background process often has huge effects on small devices like phones and tablets and some laptops. But all other security methods that I wrote about above I do actively use because they do not have a huge impact on performance.

    *Said differently, how do you consider performance within your selection process?*
      If a security method has huge effects on the performance of my device I will not use it. This is only the case on my devices becuase I have a wellrounded knowledge about security and have had experience with malware.

    *Would you rather have the best security and very low degrees of performance?*
      No I would have no security and best performance becuase performance is the main focus on all of my devices. Also I dont have data on my devices that is sensitive to my life. I am wellaware how easy it is to get data from devices and websites so I make sure that my sensitive data, like bank info is not the same as other information.

    *How would you resolve / make determinations with such potentially conflicting concepts?*
      Well as stated above becuase I dont have intense security on any of my devices Iam more careful then most when encountering potentially harmful links, sites, chats, applications.

  __Practical:__

    *Mention what types of security / endpoint protection you use.*
      I have no antivirus software besides windows basic detecion. My network has several firewalls thanks to my fathers remote job, along with having devices that are seperated from the main wifi network. For exmaple mine and my father desktops and devices are on a serpate network from the rest of my family who are highly likely to bring a virus into our network.

    *Do you use the same suite across all devices?*
      Windows and Android are the only OS's that I use which alows me to use the same suites across all my devices. This includes my favorite code editor, google chrome, adobe applications, microsoft, and discord.

    *Is the security suite that you use available across all devices (i.e. a version for Windows, Mac, tablets [iOS and Android] and phones [iOS and Android])?*
      I dont use a security suite. unless you count windows defender, which I dont consider a real security suite.

    *How are you made aware of an issue (i.e. if your device encounters a virus, etc.)?*
      There are several factors, main is performance decrease, the appearance of background processes in task manager that i dont recognize, and the alert that windows defender might give.

    *Do all of your devices report back to the same place (i.e. is there a centralized control panel of sorts that shows the security status of all of your devices OR are they all individually managed (i.e. you have to look at each device to determine if a device has an issue, etc.?)*
      I dont have a security suite, so they are all seperate. I would have to look at each device individually.
